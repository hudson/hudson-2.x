/**
 * Pipe for the remote {@link Callable} and the local program to talk to each other.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * There are two kinds of pipes. One is for having a local system write to a remote system,
 * and the other is for having a remote system write to a local system. Use
 * the different versions of the <tt>create</tt> method to create the appropriate kind
 * of pipes.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Once created, {@link Pipe} can be sent to the remote system as a part of a serialization of
 * {@link Callable} between {@link Channel}s.
 * Once re-instantiated on the remote {@link Channel}, pipe automatically connects
 * back to the local instance and perform necessary set up.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The local and remote system can then call {@link #getIn()} and {@link #getOut()} to
 * read/write bytes.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Pipe can be only written by one system and read by the other system. It is an error to
 * send one {@link Pipe} to two remote {@link Channel}s, or send one {@link Pipe} to
 * the same {@link Channel} twice.
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <pre>
 * final Pipe p = Pipe.createLocalToRemote();
 *
 * channel.callAsync(new Callable() {
 *   public Object call() {
 *     InputStream in = p.getIn();
 *     ... read from in ...
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * OutputStream out = p.getOut();
 * ... write to out ...
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Implementation Note</h2>
 * <p/>
 * For better performance, {@link Pipe} uses lower-level {@link Command} abstraction
 * to send data, instead of typed proxy object. This allows the writer to send data
 * without blocking until the arrival of the data is confirmed.
