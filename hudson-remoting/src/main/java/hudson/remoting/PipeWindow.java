/**
 * Keeps track of the number of bytes that the sender can send without overwhelming the receiver of the pipe.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * {@link OutputStream} is a blocking operation in Java, so when we send byte[] to the remote to write to
 * {@link OutputStream}, it needs to be done in a separate thread (or else we'll fail to attend to the channel
 * in timely fashion.) This in turn means the byte[] being sent needs to go to a queue between a
 * channel reader thread and I/O processing thread, and thus in turn means we need some kind of throttling
 * mechanism, or else the queue can grow too much.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * This implementation solves the problem by using TCP/IP like window size tracking. The sender allocates
 * a fixed length window size. Every time the sender sends something we reduce this value. When the receiver
 * writes data to {@link OutputStream}, it'll send back the "ack" command, which adds to this value, allowing
 * the sender to send more data.
