Title=What''s "project relationship"?
body=\
    When you have projects that depend on each other, Hudson can track which build of \
    the upstream project is used by which build of the downstream project, by using \
    the records created by \
    <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Fingerprint">the fingerprint support</a>.

Upstream\ note=Note: "upstream project" is the project which created the fingerprints, it may not be the upstream project as specified on a projects configuration page. \
  It is possible to ignore the fingerprint ownership by specifying hudson.upstreamCulprits=true system variable, the details are available <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Features+controlled+by+system+properties">here</a>.
