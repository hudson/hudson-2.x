  <h2>Create Job</h2>
  <p>
    To create a new job, post <tt>config.xml</tt> to <a href="../createItem">this URL</a> with
    query parameter <tt>name=<i>JOBNAME</i></tt>. You'll get 200 status code if the creation is successful,
    or 4xx/5xx code if it fails. <tt>config.xml</tt> is the format Hudson uses to store the project
    in the file system, so you can see examples of them in <tt>${app.rootDir}</tt>.
  </p>

  <h2>Copy Job</h2>
  <p>
    To copy a job, send a POST request to <a href="../createItem">this URL</a> with
    three query parameters <tt>name=<i>NEWJOBNAME</i>&amp;mode=copy&amp;from=<i>FROMJOBNAME</i></tt>
  </p>

  <h2>Build Queue</h2>
  <p>
    Build queue has <a href="../queue/api/">its own separate API</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Load Statistics</h2>
  <p>
    Overall load statistics of Hudson has <a href="../overallLoad/api/">its own separate API</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Restarting Hudson</h2>
  <p>
    Hudson will enter into the "quiet down" mode by sending a request to <a href="../quietDown">this URL</a>.
    You can cancel this mode by sending a request to <a href="../cancelQuietDown">this URL</a>. On environments
    where Hudson can restart itself (such as when Hudson is installed as a Windows service), POSTing to
    <a href="../restart">this URL</a> will start the restart sequence, or
    <a href="../safeRestart">this URL</a> to restart once no jobs are running.
    All these URLs need the admin privilege to the system.
  </p>
