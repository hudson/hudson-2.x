<div>
  This controls the number of concurrent builds that Hudson can perform. So the value
  affects the overall system load Hudson may incur.
  A good value to start with would be the number of processors on your system.

  <p>
  Increasing this value beyond that would cause each build to take longer, but it could increase
  the overall throughput, because it allows CPU to build one project while another build is waiting
  for I/O.

  <p>
  When using Hudson in the master/slave mode, setting this value to 0 would prevent the master
  from doing any building on its own.  Slaves may not have zero executors, but may be
  temporarily disabled using the button on the slave's status page.
