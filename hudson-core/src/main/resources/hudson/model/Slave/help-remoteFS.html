<div>
  <p>
  A slave needs to have a directory dedicated to Hudson. Specify
  the absolute path of this work directory on the slave, such as
  '/var/hudson' or 'c:\hudson'. This should be a path local to the slave
  machine. There's no need for this path to be visible from the master,
  under normal circumstances.

  <p>
  Slaves do not maintain important data (other than active workspaces
  of projects last built on it), so you can possibly set the slave
  workspace to a temporary directory. The only downside of doing this
  is that you may lose the up-to-date workspace if the slave is turned off.
