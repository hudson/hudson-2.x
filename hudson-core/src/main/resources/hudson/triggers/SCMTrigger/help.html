  Configure Hudson to poll changes in SCM.

  <p>
  Note that this is going to be an expensive operation for CVS, as every polling
  requires Hudson to scan the entire workspace and verify it with the server.
  Consider setting up a "push" trigger to avoid this overhead, as described in
  <a href="https://hudson.java.net/build.html">this document</a>
  <p>
  It's possible to use Project cascading feature for this property. Please review <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Project+cascading">
