    <p>
        Drop down gives user opportunity to select compression type which will be applied to the selected artifacts before the master-slave transfer.
        Default value GZIP, i.e. Hudson creates tgz on the slave host, sends it to master and unzips it.
        It's may sense to disable compression in case of weak server and wide network bandwidth or in case of already packed artifacts (*.jar, *.war, etc).
