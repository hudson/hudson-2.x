    Submit button themed by YUI. This should be always
    used instead of the plain &lt;input tag.

    <s:attribute name="name">
      If specified, becomes the value of the name attribute.
      When you have more than one submit button on the form, this can be used to determine
      which button is pressed, as the server will get a parameter by this name.
    </s:attribute>
    <s:attribute name="value" use="required">
      The text of the submit button. Something like "submit", "OK", etc.
    </s:attribute>
  </s:documentation>
  <input type="submit" name="${attrs.name ?: 'Submit'}" value="${attrs.value}" class="submit-button" />
