<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:st="jelly:stapler" xmlns:d="jelly:define" xmlns:f="/lib/form">
  <st:documentation>
    Generates an input field <tt>&lt;input type="text" ... /></tt> to be
    used inside &lt;f:entry/>

    <st:attribute name="field">
      Used for databinding. TBD.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="name">
      This becomes @name of the &lt;input> tag.
      If @field is specified, this value is inferred from it.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="value">
      The initial value of the field. This becomes the @value of the &lt;input> tag.
      If @field is specified, the current property from the "instance" object
      will be set as the initial value automatically,
      which is the recommended approach.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="default">
      The default value of the text box, in case both @value is and 'instance[field]' is null.
    </st:attribute>
    <!-- Tomcat doesn't like us using the attribute called 'class' -->
    <st:attribute name="clazz">
      Additional CSS class(es) to add (such as client-side validation clazz="required",
      "number" or "positive-number"; these may be combined, as clazz="required number").
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="checkMessage">
      Override the default error message when client-side validation fails,
      as with clazz="required", etc.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="checkUrl">
      If specified, the value entered in this input field will be checked (via AJAX)
      against this URL, and errors will be rendered under the text field.

      If @field is specified, this will be inferred automatically,
      which is the recommended approach.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="autoCompleteDelimChar">
      A single character that can be used as a delimiter for autocompletion. Normal
      autocomplete will replace the entire content of the text box with the autocomplete
      selection. With this attribute set, the selection will be appended with the
      delimiter to the existing value of the text box.
    </st:attribute>
  </st:documentation>
  <f:prepareDatabinding />
  ${descriptor.calcAutoCompleteSettings(field,attrs)} <!-- this figures out the 'autoCompleteUrl' attribute -->

  <!-- mostly pass-through all the attributes -->
