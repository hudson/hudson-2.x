    <st:attribute name="field">
      Used for databinding. TBD.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="name">
      This becomes @name of the &lt;input> tag.
      If @field is specified, this value is inferred from it.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="value">
      The initial value of the field. This becomes the @value of the &lt;input> tag.
      If @field is specified, the current property from the "instance" object
      will be set as the initial value automatically,
      which is the recommended approach.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="clazz">
      Additional CSS class(es) to add (such as client-side validation clazz="required",
      "number" or "positive-number"; these may be combined, as clazz="required number").
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="checkUrl">
      If specified, the value entered in this input field will be checked (via AJAX)
      against this URL, and errors will be rendered under the text field.

      If @field is specified, this will be inferred automatically,
      which is the recommended approach.
