  <st:documentation>
    single-line textbox that can be expanded into a multi-line textarea.

    This control is useful for a field that expects multiple whitespaec-separated tokens
    (such as URLs, glob patterns, etc.) When the user only enters a few tokens,
    they can keep it as a single line to save space, but to enter a large number of values,
    this can be turned into textarea for better visibility.

    If the initial value is already multi-line text, the control starts with
    textarea.

    On the server side, your program is responsible for treating ' ', \t, \r, and \n for
    separators. (StringTokenizer would do this.)

    <st:attribute name="field">
      Used for databinding. TBD.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="name">
      This becomes @name of the &lt;input> tag.
      If @field is specified, this value is inferred from it.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="value">
      The initial value of the field. This becomes the @value of the &lt;input> tag.
      If @field is specified, the current property from the "instance" object
      will be set as the initial value automatically,
      which is the recommended approach.
