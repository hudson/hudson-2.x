  If the tag is used during the full HTML page generation, <ajax> tag becomes
  no-op and simply invokes its body.

  If the page is used as a top-level tag, it sets up the environment
  for generating partial HTML contents (which can be then injected into the existing
  page via client-side script.)

  See MatrixProject/index.jelly and ajaxMatrix.jelly for how to use this tag.
