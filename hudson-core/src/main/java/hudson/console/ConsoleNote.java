/**
 * Data that hangs off from a console output.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@link ConsoleNote} can be put into a console output while it's being written, and it represents
 * a machine readable information about a particular position of the console output.
 *
 * <p>
 * When Hudson is reading back a console output for display, a {@link ConsoleNote} is used
 * to trigger {@link ConsoleAnnotator}, which in turn uses the information in the note to
 * generate markup. In this way, we can overlay richer information on top of the console output.
 *
 * <h2>Comparison with {@link ConsoleAnnotatorFactory}</h2>
 * <p>
 * Compared to {@link ConsoleAnnotatorFactory}, the main advantage of {@link ConsoleNote} is that
 * it can be emitted into the output by the producer of the output (or by a filter), which can
 * have a much better knowledge about the context of what's being executed.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * For example, when your plugin is about to report an error message, you can emit a {@link ConsoleNote}
 * that indicates an error, instead of printing an error message as plain text. The {@link #annotate(Object, MarkupText, int)}
 * method will then generate the proper error message, with all the HTML markup that makes error message
 * more user friendly.
 *
 * <li>
 * Or consider annotating output from Ant. A modified {@link BuildListener} can place a {@link ConsoleNote}
 * every time a new target execution starts. These notes can be then later used to build the outline
 * that shows what targets are executed, hyperlinked to their corresponding locations in the build output.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * Doing these things by {@link ConsoleAnnotatorFactory} would be a lot harder, as they can only rely
 * on the pattern matching of the output.
 *
 * <h2>Persistence</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link ConsoleNote}s are serialized and gzip compressed into a byte sequence and then embedded into the
 * console output text file, with a bit of preamble/postamble to allow tools to ignore them. In this way
 * {@link ConsoleNote} always sticks to a particular point in the console output.
 *
 * <p>
 * This design allows descendant processes of Hudson to emit {@link ConsoleNote}s. For example, Ant forked
 * by a shell forked by Hudson can put an encoded note in its stdout, and Hudson will correctly understands that.
 * The preamble and postamble includes a certain ANSI escape sequence designed in such a way to minimize garbage
 * if this output is observed by a human being directly.
 *
 * <p>
 * Because of this persistence mechanism, {@link ConsoleNote}s need to be serializable, and care should be taken
 * to reduce footprint of the notes, if you are putting a lot of notes. Serialization format compatibility
 * is also important, although {@link ConsoleNote}s that failed to deserialize will be simply ignored, so the
 * worst thing that can happen is that you just lose some notes.
 *
 * <h2>Behaviour, JavaScript, and CSS</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link ConsoleNote} can have associated <tt>script.js</tt> and <tt>style.css</tt> (put them
 * in the same resource directory that you normally put Jelly scripts), which will be loaded into
 * the HTML page whenever the console notes are used. This allows you to use minimal markup in
 * code generation, and do the styling in CSS and perform the rest of the interesting work as a CSS behaviour/JavaScript.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *      Contextual model object that this console is associated with, such as {@link Run}.
