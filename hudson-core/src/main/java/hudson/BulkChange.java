/**
 * Transaction-like object that can be used to make a bunch of changes to an object, and defer the
 * {@link Saveable#save()} until the end.
 *
 * <p>
 * The usage of {@link BulkChange} needs to follow a specific closure-like pattern, namely:
 *
 * <pre>
 * BulkChange bc = new BulkChange(someObject);
 * try {
 *    ... make changes to 'someObject'
 * } finally {
 *    bc.commit();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * ... or if you'd like to avoid saving when something bad happens:
 *
 * <pre>
 * BulkChange bc = new BulkChange(someObject);
 * try {
 *    ... make changes to 'someObject'
 *    bc.commit();
 * } finally {
 *    bc.abort();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Use of this method is optional. If {@link BulkChange} is not used, individual mutator
 * will perform the save operation, and things will just run somewhat slower.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Cooperation from {@link Saveable}</h2>
 * <p>
 * For this class to work as intended, {@link Saveable} implementations need to co-operate.
 * Namely,
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Mutater methods should invoke {@code this.save()} so that if the method is called outside
 * a {@link BulkChange}, the result will be saved immediately.
 *
 * <li>
 * In the {@code save()} method implementation, use {@link #contains(Saveable)} and
 * only perform the actual I/O operation when this method returns false.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * See {@link Hudson#save()} as an example if you are not sure how to implement {@link Saveable}.
