/**
 * Extension point that defines more elaborate way of killing processes, such as
 * sudo or pfexec, for {@link ProcessTree}.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 * <p>
 * Each implementation of {@link ProcessKiller} is instantiated once on the master.
 * Whenever a process needs to be killed, those implementations are serialized and sent over
 * to the appropriate slave, then the {@link #kill(hudson.util.ProcessTree.OSProcess)} method is invoked
 * to attempt to kill the process.
 *
 * <p>
 * One of the consequences of this design is that the implementation should be stateless
 * and concurrent-safe. That is, the {@link #kill(hudson.util.ProcessTree.OSProcess)} method can be invoked by multiple threads
 * concurrently on the single instance.
 *
 * <p>
 * Another consequence of this design is that if your {@link ProcessKiller} requires configuration,
 * it needs to be serializable, and configuration needs to be updated atomically, as another
 * thread may be calling into {@link #kill(hudson.util.ProcessTree.OSProcess)} just when you are updating your configuration.
