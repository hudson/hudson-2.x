/**
 * Parses test result files and builds in-memory representation of it as {@link TestResult}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This extension point encapsulates the knowledge of a particular test report format and its parsing process,
 * thereby improving the pluggability of test result parsing; integration with a new test tool can be done
 * by just writing a parser, without writing a custom {@link hudson.tasks.Publisher}, and the test reports are displayed
 * with the default UI and recognized by the rest of Hudson as test reports.
 *
 * <p>
 * Most typical implementations of this class should extend from {@link DefaultTestResultParserImpl},
 * which handles a set of default error checks on user inputs. 
 *
 * <p>
 * Parsers are stateless, and the {@link #parse(String, hudson.model.AbstractBuild, hudson.Launcher, hudson.model.TaskListener)} method
 * can be concurrently invoked by multiple threads for different builds.

     * difference in the master/slave into account.

     *      If the user cancels the build, it will be received as a thread interruption. Do not catch
     *      it, and instead just forward that through the call stack.
     * @throws IOException
     *      If you don't care about handling exceptions gracefully, you can just throw IOException
     *      and let the default exception handling in Hudson takes care of it.
     * @throws hudson.AbortException
