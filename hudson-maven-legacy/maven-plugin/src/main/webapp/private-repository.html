  Normally, Hudson uses the local Maven repository as determined by Maven
    in <tt>~/.m2/repository</tt>, which can be overridden by
  &lt;localRepository&gt; in <tt>~/.m2/settings.xml</tt> (see <a
        href="http://maven.apache.org/settings.html">the reference</a> for more details.)

  <p>
  This normally means that all the jobs that are executed on the same node shares a single Maven repository.
  The upside of this is that you can save the disk space, but the downside of this is that sometimes those
  builds could interfere with each other. For example, you might end up having builds incorrectly succeed,
  just because your have all the dependencies in your local repository, despite that fact that none of the
  repositories in POM might have them.

  <p>
  There are also some reported problems regarding having concurrent Maven processes trying to use the same local
  repository.


  <p>
  When this option is checked, Hudson will tell Maven to use <tt>$WORKSPACE/.repository</tt> as the local Maven repository.
  This means each job will get its own isolated Maven repository just for itself. It fixes the above problems,
  at the expense of additional disk space consumption.

  <p>
  When using this option, consider setting up a Maven artifact manager so that you don't have to hit
  remote Maven repositories too often.
