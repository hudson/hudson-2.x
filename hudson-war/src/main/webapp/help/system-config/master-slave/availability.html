        <dd>
            This is the default and normal setting.
            In this mode, Hudson uses tries to keep the slave on-line.
            If Hudson can start the slave without user assistance, it will periodically
            attempt to restart the slave if it is unavailable.
            Hudson will not take the slave off-line.
        </dd>

        <dt><b>
            Take this slave on-line and off-line at specific times
        </b></dt>
        <dd>
            In this mode, Hudson will keep the slave on-line according to the configured schedule.
            If Hudson can start the slave without user assistance, it will periodically
            attempt to start the slave if it is unavailable during an on-line window.

            During an off-line window, the slave will only be taken off-line if there are no active
            jobs running on the slave.
        </dd>

        <dt><b>
            Take this slave on-line when in demand and off-line when idle
        </b></dt>
        <dd>
            In this mode, if Hudson can launch the slave without user assistance, it will periodically
            attempt to launch the slave while there are unexecuted jobs which meet the following criteria:
            <ul>
                <li>They have been in the queue for at least the specified startup demand period</li>
                <li>They can execute on this slave</li>
            </ul>

            The slave will be taken off-line if:
            <ul>
                <li>There are no active jobs running on the slave</li>
                <li>The slave has been idle for at least the specified idle period</li>
            </ul>
