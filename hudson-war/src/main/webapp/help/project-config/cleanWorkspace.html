  If your project requires a clean workspace for each build, select this option.
  This will delete all contents inside the workspace folder at the beginning of
  each build. A side-effect of this is that you will end up doing a fresh
  checkout from source control for each build.
  <p>
  It's possible to use Project cascading feature for this property. Please review <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Project+cascading">
  this document</a>.
