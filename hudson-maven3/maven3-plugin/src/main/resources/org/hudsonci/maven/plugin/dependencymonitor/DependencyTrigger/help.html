<div>
Schedule a new build for this project when notified about updated
    dependencies from other projects built within the server.  This works in
    tandem with the 'Notify that Maven dependencies have been updated by
    maven 3 integration' post-build action.
<br/><br/>
This is convenient for running an extensive test after a build is complete, for example.
