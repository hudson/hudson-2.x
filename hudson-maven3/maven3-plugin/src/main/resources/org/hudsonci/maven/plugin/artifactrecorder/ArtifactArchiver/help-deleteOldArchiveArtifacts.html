        Discard all but the last successful/stable artifact to save disk space.
    </p>

    <p>
        If checked, most artifacts from older builds will be discarded.
        Artifacts from the last stable former build (if any) are kept, and also those
        from the last unstable build if that is newer, and from the last failed
        build if that is newer.
    </p>

    <p>
        This option saves disk space, but still lets you safely create permalinks
        such as <code>.../lastStableBuild/artifact/...</code> or
        <code>.../lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/...</code> or
        <code>.../lastCompletedBuild/artifact/...</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        (Since the current build is still running, the Server conservatively assumes
        that it might yet fail in a publisher - so it keeps at least one older builds
        artifacts around.)
